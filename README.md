# Scrapers

This repository is written with scrapy.

- createdb crawler(if you are using postgresql)
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Of course if you want to use Postgresql you can also run **postsql.sh** to start database in your local machine(just for my own convenience). I used SQLAlchemy so if anyone wants to change the database you will have to do some modifications based on that. If nobody wants to do it, you can leave it to me.
